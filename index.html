    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>In the E-Laas project, a novel and operational energy-based approach to designing multimodal urban logistics
        systems is proposed.
        As such, urban delivery systems are compared by their energy used,
        including modal shift (micro platforms) and novel ways of combining
        charging and freight parking. This energy-based quantitative methodology enables us to
        systematically and naturally define sustainability aims. Thus, our overall aim with E-Laas
        is to create a novel energy minimizing method from consolidation centers to the customers' doors incentivizing
        energy savings at each level. Furthermore, the energy-based methodology enables us to contrast different modular
        solutions via the concept of interlaced energy footprinting.</p>
    <p>The aims of the project are:
    <ul>
        <li>A1: representing urban logistics missions as logistics flows.</li>
        <li>A2: defining operational (and complementary) energy use in logistics flows. </li>
        <li>A3: analyzing spatio-temporal energy usage in urban logistics missions and perform sensitivity analysis
            (grid interruption, scalability).</li>
        <li>A4: energy awareness on multiple levels (from customers to asuthorities) is aimed to incentivize.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assumptions, Project Objectives and Targets</h2>
    <h3>Assumptions</h3>
    <p>
    <dl>
        <dt>&#9824 AP1: We assume that the flow of goods related to the development of civilization
            together with consumption will not cease to increase. If no coordinated actions are done,
            it will negatively impact our lives.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 AP2: The development of digital and telecommunications techniques makes it possible to implement IoT,
            ICT,
            and ITS solutions in cities. It is hence assumed that relevant operational, and real-time data are
            available.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 AP3: The development of synchronized, energy-optimal operational actions is assumed to enhance
            sustainability, efficiency,
            and social awareness of city logistics since we leverage optimization methods to improve the systems. As
            such, we also assume
            that the problems of urban logistics operations can be explicitly formulated as optimization problems, for
            which some modelling
            assumptions will be needed.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 AP4: It is assumed that increased environmental awareness of residents and service providers related
            to the implementation
            of new solutions will positively impact the sustainable transition.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 AP5: Calibration data to emulate service aspects behind E-Laas is provided by the partners/publicly
            available. Customers behave rationally.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 AP6: Socio aspects can be interpreted within/map to the energy aware methodology.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 AP7: We assume that cities will have an overview, and can use E-Laas to create legal standards to
            incentivise resource optimal urban shipping.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 AP8: Solution and technological tools to make the impact via the E-Laas methods exist and are
            operational.</dt>
    </dl>
    </p>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>
    <dl>
        <dt>&#9824 O1: contributing to sustainable developments of cities and communities.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 O2: creating resilient logistics methods, digital and physical infrastructure for sustainable
            transport solutions.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 O3: developing sustainable and climate-responsive urban logistic systems.</dt>
    </dl>
    </p>
    <h3>Targets</h3>
    <p>
    <dl>
        <dt>&#9824 T1: Develop energy-optimal urban logistics solutions (from consolidation centers to doors).</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 T2: Develop smart multimodal and energy optimizing micro delivery systems.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 T3: Analyze logistics mission interruptions and advise with reconfiguration solutions to regain
            energy optimality.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 T4: Couple delivery platforms and unloading zones via charging facility to the power grid.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 T5: Quantify demand for freight and analyze the customer behavior change required to run the project
            E-Laas.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 T6: Scalability of multimodal and energy optimal distribution system.</dt>
        <dt>&#9824 T7: Devise new ways to enhance societal responsibility by E-Laas.</dt>

    <h2>Key Activities and Work Programme Description</h2>
    <h3>Overall strategy for the work plan</h3>
    <p>
        We focus on teamwork, and all work packages are done by multiple partners. Four universities as the main
        partners will be more active in the project to undertake
        the core research work. However, other cooperation partners, including public sectors and companies, will be
        less work loading responsible for the collaborative
        work and undertaking the auxiliary work of providing data, pilot implementation, policy support, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project is composed of 7 work packages combined into a logical workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
        WP0 is the starting task of the project. It develops detailed assumptions for the implementation of further works. The realization of WPs 1, 2, 3, and 4 is parallel. WP1 is independent of WP3 and WP4, which are closely related according to the implementation methodology. WP2 will be implemented on the base of assumptions from WP0 and will be fed with the results of WPs 1, 3, and 4, influencing the final result. WP2 and WP3 contain simulation studies, but at a different level of detail, it should be emphasized that research in WP2 is of fundamental nature to gain new knowledge, and in WP3, applied research to verify and validate the developed mathematical models and algorithms. WP5 is aimed at consolidating the project results in the assumed impact path and will also consider the effects of analyses from WP2. 
The WP6 aims to ensure unrestricted and broad access to the project's results, implementation progress, and the distribution of its outcomes among stakeholders.
    </p>
    <h3>Timing of different WPs and components</h3>
    <p>In Figures 2 and 3, the interconnection of WPs is depicted. In Fig 3, the coupling among the WPs is shown; arrows indicate the information and data coupling between two consecutive WPs. Fig 2 describes the timeline of WPs, including milestones and deliverables. Risk assessment is added too, see dashed WPs. Each and every WP has its respective deliverables and milestones to achieve. In the project E-Laas, we intend to create a new research community, too, meaning that Co-Applicants will be involved in nearly all WPs. This is done intentionally. However, the level of involvement changes from WP to WP.</p>
